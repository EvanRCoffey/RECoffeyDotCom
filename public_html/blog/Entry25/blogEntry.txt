Tomorrow begins December, and boy, is it going to be a doozy.  As soon as I'm ready, I can take my online Biology final.  Then, on the 14h, I go to my last Computer Architecture class and, thus, the last class of my A.S. in computer science.  Three days later is my last shift at Fleming's.  Two days after that, I drive (from Austin) to Biloxi, MS to spend 5 days with my family, then it's over to Pensacola, FL to spend 5 days with the in-laws.  Finally, it's back to Austin, just in time for New Years Eve and, hopefully, a new job.

Goodbye, Fleming's!

That's right - I'm looking for a new job!  As I just mentioned, I gave my notice at Fleming's.  I don't have anything lined up at the moment, but I'm going to have M-F 8-5 free for the first time in quite a while, and I'm hoping I'll be able to find something to do during those hours.  If I can find work as a web developer, that would be AWESOME, but if I do something else for a little while, that's fine, too.

Speaking of web development, the boot camp is in full effect.  Since my last post, I've completed the following homework assignments:

-Classical Composer Hangman: a website with five classical composers' last names to be guessed Hangman-style, with accompanying music clips

-Star Wars RPG Game: a website with four star wars characters, one of which you can select to attack and vanquish the other three

-Sci-Fi Movie Trivia Game: an eight-question multiple choice trivia game with some gifs and fun sound bytes

The class moves at a pretty fast and steady pace.  I feel like we've already covered a lot of information, so far.  I hope it stays this way after we return from the holiday break.

2017 is going to bring some big changes.  I'm nervous and excited.
