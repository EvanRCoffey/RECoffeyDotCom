	November 21st, 2015 - On the Hunt
</div>

Hello, again! &nbsp;It's been a few months since my last entry. &nbsp;Lots has happened since then, so let's get started!<br />
<br />
As the summer came to an end, so did my web development curriculum. &nbsp;I ended up completing tutorials for HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP on w3schools.com and codecademy.com. &nbsp;I also downloaded a few HTML editors to get a feel for them, and while I only completed one real website (more on that later), I did toy around with a few personal ideas just to get my hands dirty with the material before I put it away. &nbsp;Then, I organized all of my notes and left everything where, when needed, I could pull it out and pick back up where I left off. &nbsp;I don't have any more plans to use those skills at the moment, but I'm still glad I took the time to learn them.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ufawLmiBkco/VlDDICbXmHI/AAAAAAAAAN4/rOBcihEwRWw/s1600/59beaeaf0b1316e01d82ab85b6d4e8c5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-ufawLmiBkco/VlDDICbXmHI/AAAAAAAAAN4/rOBcihEwRWw/s320/59beaeaf0b1316e01d82ab85b6d4e8c5.jpg" width="212" /></a></div>
For the Fall 2015 semester, I have been enrolled in Calculus II and Programming Fundamentals II. &nbsp;I'll be finishing them up in just a few weeks. &nbsp;Both Calculus I and II have been a real challenge for me compared to math classes from my past, but Programming Fundamentals has been comparatively easy. &nbsp;Luckily, writing code has come pretty naturally up til now - hopefully it'll stay that way as the problems get more and more complex.<br />
<br />
I've already signed up for my Spring 2016 semester classes, and I'm excited that I'll finally have two computer classes, instead of the 50/50 splits I've been having. &nbsp;I'll be taking Programming Fundamentals III (Data Structures) and Computer Organization and Machine Language (PC Assembly). &nbsp;I'm stoked.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dDuXmwsWsT8/VlDEFsGlcwI/AAAAAAAAAOI/2pV-cPmAPbU/s1600/binary_slam_medlarge490.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="203" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dDuXmwsWsT8/VlDEFsGlcwI/AAAAAAAAAOI/2pV-cPmAPbU/s640/binary_slam_medlarge490.gif" width="640" /></a></div>
Another thing I'm stoked about is that I have (finally!) decided on my precise career plans for the next year and a half. &nbsp;Instead of transferring to a 4-year university as quickly as possible like I originally planned, I will be staying at ACC for a few more semesters to complete an Associate's in Computer Science. &nbsp;There are two big reasons I have made this decision:<br />
<br />
1) It's convenient - with the transfer credits from my bachelor's degree, at the end of this semester, I will have completed 38/60 credits necessary for the associate's. &nbsp;At the end of the Spring 2016 semester, I will have completed 45/60. &nbsp;From there, it will be easy for me to finish, and quickly. &nbsp;It's also affordable, and I've already got financial aid lined up to pay for it. &nbsp;The convenience will open up more time for me to focus on work and enhance my resume/portfolio.<br />
<br />
2) The career specialization I have chosen does not require extensive education to get an entry-level job. &nbsp;My focus will be on two areas of tech to begin my career: programming, and information technology (IT). &nbsp;I have chosen these not only because I feel they give me the best chance of actually entering the industry in a reasonable length of time, but also because I need a field that meshes well with a rural lifestyle, where Lesley and I hope to one day be. &nbsp;IT jobs are everywhere - even rural areas - and programming can (theoretically) be done from anywhere. &nbsp;Additionally, the generalized nature of the Computer Science degree means that I still have some flexibility, should my career take an unexpected turn.<br />
<br />
So, between now and the summer of 2017, that's what I'll be doing - going to school, beefing up my portfolio in my spare time, and working. &nbsp;Where will I be working, you ask? &nbsp;I'll talk about that in a minute, but first...<br />
<br />
I'm a married man! &nbsp;On October 5th, 2015, I married the love of my life. &nbsp;We were wed under a pavillion at the Boardwalk Resort at Walt Disney World, in Florida, but we could've done it in open air, the weather was so beautiful that day. &nbsp;However, of course, nothing that day was as beautiful as my bride.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd0MRnee5ho/VlDAiKIq_SI/AAAAAAAAANs/IPSmPIKVmeY/s1600/GetImageWithCaching.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Yd0MRnee5ho/VlDAiKIq_SI/AAAAAAAAANs/IPSmPIKVmeY/s640/GetImageWithCaching.jpg" width="425" /></a></div>
We stayed at Disney for a few days after the wedding, which was a lot of fun. &nbsp;It took a good bit of planning, and I'd be lying if I said there weren't a few stressful moments, but overall, it was a wonderful experience. &nbsp;I'm happy to have returned from the honeymoon to a great big life ahead of me with my new life partner.<br />
<br />
(Oh, and by the way, the website I worked on during the summer was a simple wedding website for friends and family. &nbsp;I didn't want to spoil the wedding surprise for any new readers.)<br />
<br />
So, what's ahead of me, then? &nbsp;Well, I'm happy to say that I'm finally going to put myself out there and attempt to find work outside the restaurant industry. &nbsp;I'm not sure how long it will take until I find a good fit, and I'm not sure exactly what work I'll end up doing, but I need to start my journey somewhere, and I'm ready to start it now. &nbsp;Luckily, my Spring schedule is pretty open, so there's a wide variety of jobs I should be able to apply for, and I can start as soon as December 28th. &nbsp;Hopefully, one of them will turn out to be a change worth making.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to blog more often now that the job hunt has started and I'm ready to focus more on my new career. &nbsp;I've been lying low for a while, handling other areas of my life while learning bit by bit that which I needed to decide on a specialization. &nbsp;Now, I have, and I want to start to feel the same way about computers that I did about music. &nbsp;I sense more and more every day that I made the correct decision to work with computers. &nbsp;I can't wait to see if I'm right.<br />
