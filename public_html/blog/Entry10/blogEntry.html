<span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>On the road again... I just can't wait to get on the road again...</i></span></div>
<br />
Well, hello
there!<br />
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
They say
good things come to those who wait, so this entry should be a great read!&nbsp; It’s been 8 months since I last updated
aMaCaDaD, and I have lots to talk about.&nbsp;
Let’s get started, shall we?<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
I no longer
live in California.&nbsp; Later on, I’ll
explain what I’m doing now, but in the meantime, I’d like to talk a bit about
my time there.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
California,
sadly, was not kind to me.&nbsp; For most of
2013, I struggled financially in a way I never had before.&nbsp; Due to the cost of living of the area, the obstacles
brought on by my job, and the depletion of my savings by the move, I ended up
having to borrow quite a bit of money from loved ones in order to pay my bills
on time.&nbsp; It hurt my pride, but I needed
help.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
Additionally,
around September, small amounts of cash began turning up missing, and after
setting up a hidden camera in the apartment, my girlfriend and I learned that
our roommate had been stealing from us.&nbsp; We
discussed the situation, and, given that we were already planning on moving
away at the end of the year, we decided to secure our belongings from the
roommate, get extra footage of her in the act to protect ourselves in case it
escalated, and just avoid confronting her about it until we could get the heck
out of dodge.&nbsp; A timely promotion at work
eased my financial burden a bit, and after a 4-month period filled with nothing
but work and trying to make sense of the difficult year I was going through, we
left.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
I’ll save
you the boo-hoo’s and the why-me’s, but California wasn’t only stressful
because of money.&nbsp; I also had some
growing up to do that I had been putting off.&nbsp;
I won a trip to Dublin, Ireland to play in the Pro Tour for Magic: The
Gathering that I ultimately had to cancel because I couldn’t take the time off
of work.&nbsp; I ended up realizing I couldn’t
maintain my devotion to the game if I wanted to achieve the goals I was setting
for myself, so I quit and sold my entire collection. &nbsp;I had to learn how to successfully navigate an
adult, live-in relationship.&nbsp; I had to
embrace the gravity of my decision to start an entirely new career.&nbsp; I had to learn to cope with things not going
my way all the time.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
Luckily, I
think I handled it all pretty well.&nbsp;
Things are going great with the girlfriend, we safely avoided
confrontation with the roommate, and I feel like a different, more mature
person.&nbsp; It was a tough year, but it was
worth it.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
So, now I’m
back in my home state of Mississippi, and my situation is much better.&nbsp; I’m working at a restaurant here, and money
is good.&nbsp; I’m living with my parents, so
I’m able to save much of what I earn.&nbsp; I
used my tax refund to pay back the debt I accrued in 2013; aside from student
loans, I’m 100% out of the hole.&nbsp; My
girlfriend has been spending some time with her family, but in a couple of
weeks, she’ll be moving in with me.&nbsp; I’ve
come back up from the low mental state I fell to in California, and I’m
starting to remember what optimism feels like.&nbsp;
I’ve resumed my studies with C++, and I’m excited to keep learning.&nbsp; But the best piece of news?&nbsp; Well, that requires a drumroll.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">

My
girlfriend was just offered a position as a Montessori guide in Austin, Texas,
and we’ll be moving there in just over 4 months.&nbsp; She starts mid-July.</div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
It’s so nice
to finally have some clear direction as to where our life is headed and how we
should prepare for it.&nbsp; I have a new
outlook on life – one that I’m happy to blog about!<o:p></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
My plans for
between now and July include getting back in physical shape (I admittedly let
myself go a bit last year), saving as much money as I can, and learning as much
about computers as I can.&nbsp; The goal is to
establish residency in Texas so that I can get in-state tuition at one of the
colleges there – preferably, The University of Texas in Austin – for the fall
2015 semester.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
Unfortunately,
while in California, I didn’t study much more about C++ than what I detailed in
the previous blog entry.&nbsp; In fact, I actually
took a break from it, altogether.&nbsp; Thus,
when I got back into it a few weeks ago, I basically had to start from scratch.&nbsp; Also unfortunately, in late 2013, my hard
drive failed, and I had to replace it.&nbsp;
Thus, many of my C++ notes were lost.&nbsp;
So, in the last few weeks, I’ve spent quite some time studying, but half
of that time was just re-learning the things I already blogged about.&nbsp; However, I eventually overcame that hurdle
and have since learned some new concepts: arrays, structures, and pointers.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
As I’ve
stated previously in this blog, I don’t want to get too jargon-y.&nbsp; However, I get the feeling that, the farther
I get in my studies, the more difficult it will be to explain what I’m learning
without said jargon.&nbsp; Until then, I’ll do
my best.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
Arrays and
structures are similar, in that they are items which constitute a collection of
other items.&nbsp; The difference between them
is that arrays are made up of items of one data type, while structures are made
up of items of several different data types.&nbsp;
In other words, an array is a basket of apples, while a structure is a
basket of apples, oranges, bananas, and melons.&nbsp;
They’re pretty intuitive concepts and were easy for me to grasp.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
Pointers, on
the other hand, have been a bit more challenging.&nbsp; Essentially, a pointer is not a piece of
data, but it is an object which points at another piece of data.&nbsp; They are used primarily for efficient use of
memory.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
To explain:
imagine you have a program which organizes and manipulates statistics of baseball
players.&nbsp; Say you want this program to
include height, weight, RBI, salary, and several other pieces of data on every
baseball player in a league, and you want to be able to manipulate that data in
various ways.&nbsp; If you created structures
to contain the data and were constantly copy-pasting those structures,
eventually, you’d end up using a lot of space.&nbsp;
However, with pointers, instead of moving large chunks of data around
repeatedly, you create much smaller items which simply point the original chunks
of data.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
This may
sound easy enough, but once I started to have to think in terms of memory
addresses, it became difficult for me to conceptualize, as it was abstract and
unlike any kind of thinking I had done with computers up to that point (get
it?&nbsp; point?).&nbsp; However, I spent some time with it, and now I’m
comfortable enough to move on to the next chapter of my book.&nbsp; Next up: loops and relational expressions!<o:p></o:p></div>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
Before I go,
I’d like to briefly mention how my relationship with the military came to a
close.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
As stated in
previous entries, the only real reason I got excited about the military in the
first place was because I was led to believe, not only by friends and family
but by the Air Force website, that I stood a good chance at starting as an
officer.&nbsp; Long story short, it took me way,
way, wayyyyyyyyyyyyyy too long to learn that I actually stood no chance
whatsoever.&nbsp; Only after I moved back home
and contacted an Officer Training School recruiter in this area was I finally
told that the Air Force was not even considering applicants without technical
degrees.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
The thought
of many other people, exactly like myself, being misled and wasting the amount
of energy that I wasted on a meaningless pursuit, is frustrating.&nbsp; I could’ve done so many other things with
that time, but instead, I spent it leaving voicemails, writing emails,
scheduling appointments, talking to friends and family members, making plans,
and so on, all to ultimately be told that I shouldn’t have bothered in the
first place.<o:p></o:p></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
<br /></div>
<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin-bottom: .0001pt; margin-bottom: 0in;">
I guess all
I can say is that now, I don’t have to worry about wasting any more time, and I
can focus on getting this career change done the good, old-fashioned way.&nbsp; I’m glad someone finally took the 30 seconds
to call me on the phone and tell me the truth.<o:p></o:p></div>

Hopefully,
the next blog entry won’t take 8 months.&nbsp;
I have a little bit of momentum going with C++, and I hope to keep
it.&nbsp; I still have a lot to learn, but the
more I do, the more interesting it becomes.&nbsp;
Here’s hoping it stays that way.<o:p></o:p></div>
