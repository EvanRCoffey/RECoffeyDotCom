Happy 2016!  Are you excited about this year?  I definitely am.

So, since my last blog entry, I have made a slight change of plans for the Spring semester.  Whereas before, I was hoping to find a part-time job, I have now decided instead to take a full-time courseload during the day and continue to just work nights at Fleming's.  I'll give the job hunt another shot towards the end of this semester, but for now, I want to get as many classes out of the way as I can, while I can.

I've already got my  class schedule for this semester!  I'll be taking an online class for Programming Fundamentals III: Data Structures.  Then, my other three classes are all on the same days and same campus: Intro to Philosophy, US History I, and US History II.

The way the US History courses are taught is cool, and convenient.  Instead of taking both 3-credit classes concurrently, I'll essentially be taking one 6-credit course which covers all of the material for both by the end of the semester.  Thus, the class meeting time is twice as long as a normal class.  This is nice, because I don't have to constantly oscillate between two different periods of history as I bounce from I to II and back again.

I'm pretty stoked about my classes.  I find all of the material interesting and am happy to continue to develop my programming skills.

After these four courses are complete, I'll only have four more courses between me and my associate's in computer science from Austin Community College.  I've made it a goal to finish by the end of the year, and that shouldn't be too difficult now that I've loaded up for the Spring.

Other than work and school, I'll keep writing code and learning new things in my spare time.  Until next time...
