	January 8th, 2016 - The Spring 2016 Semester
</div>

Happy 2016! &nbsp;Are you excited about this year? &nbsp;I definitely am.<br />
<br />
So, since my last blog entry, I have made a slight change of plans for the Spring semester. &nbsp;Whereas before, I was hoping to find a part-time job, I have now decided instead to take a full-time courseload during the day and continue to just work nights at Fleming's. &nbsp;I'll give the job hunt another shot towards the end of this semester, but for now, I want to get as many classes out of the way as I can, while I can.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vwvXEyRr8FU/Vo_Lm-KxsPI/AAAAAAAAAOs/6Gmrfw2dr5A/s1600/c6d1641b86af60c407b1be511ea2d9577204f310a40f2b66cae4206d6a8763f8.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="279" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vwvXEyRr8FU/Vo_Lm-KxsPI/AAAAAAAAAOs/6Gmrfw2dr5A/s320/c6d1641b86af60c407b1be511ea2d9577204f310a40f2b66cae4206d6a8763f8.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
I've already got my &nbsp;class schedule for this semester! &nbsp;I'll be taking an online class for Programming Fundamentals III: Data Structures. &nbsp;Then, my other three classes are all on the same days and same campus: Intro to Philosophy, US History I, and US History II.<br />
<br />
The way the US History courses are taught is cool, and convenient. &nbsp;Instead of taking both 3-credit classes concurrently, I'll essentially be taking one 6-credit course which covers all of the material for both by the end of the semester. &nbsp;Thus, the class meeting time is twice as long as a normal class. &nbsp;This is nice, because I don't have to constantly oscillate between two different periods of history as I bounce from I to II and back again.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L2e-oQ9r6N8/Vo_L9Id-ztI/AAAAAAAAAO0/FzX7MD6n0ss/s1600/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="206" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L2e-oQ9r6N8/Vo_L9Id-ztI/AAAAAAAAAO0/FzX7MD6n0ss/s320/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
I'm pretty stoked about my classes. &nbsp;I find all of the material interesting and am happy to continue to develop my programming skills.<br />
<br />
After these four courses are complete, I'll only have four more courses between me and my associate's in computer science from Austin Community College. &nbsp;I've made it a goal to finish by the end of the year, and that shouldn't be too difficult now that I've loaded up for the Spring.<br />
<br />
Other than work and school, I'll keep writing code and learning new things in my spare time. &nbsp;Until next time...
