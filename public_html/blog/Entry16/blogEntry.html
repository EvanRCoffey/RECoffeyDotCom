	March 9th, 2015 - South by South WHAAAAAAAAAT?!
</div>

The unseasonably cold weather has passed. &nbsp;Spring is on its way, along with its Break.<br />
<br />
However, "break" is misleading. &nbsp;Not only will I still be working, but I'll be doing something very cool. &nbsp;South by Southwest is coming to Austin, and Google, yes, Google, has bought out Fleming's for the entire festival. &nbsp;For one full week, I will be serving steaks to some of the most brilliant tech minds in the country. &nbsp;I'm giddy like an 8-year old girl getting ready for a One Direction concert. &nbsp;I plan to get Sergey and Larry drunk a few times, dazzle them with my charm and charisma, and have a job offer by week's end. &nbsp;I'm feeling confident.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OkzzB7aP3rI/VP4CxwZPeLI/AAAAAAAAALY/DICOLQnrYTk/s1600/witch%2Bfrom%2Bsnow%2Bwhite.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="219" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-OkzzB7aP3rI/VP4CxwZPeLI/AAAAAAAAALY/DICOLQnrYTk/s1600/witch%2Bfrom%2Bsnow%2Bwhite.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
<br />
Before then, however, I've still got another week of class to get through, and things in that department are finally starting to warm up! &nbsp;In Calculus, we have covered a good bit of algebra and trig review, plus limits, derivatives, and a few other things. &nbsp;I've had two exams in there so far - 99 and 95. &nbsp;In Programming Fundamentals, we've covered lots and lots of building blocks. &nbsp;The lab that's due next includes a function that asks for a monetary amount owed and another amount paid and calculates the number of dollars, quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies owed in change, and another function which deals two players a random playing card, then determines the highest card, and, thus, the winner. &nbsp;Just to give an idea of what we've covered. &nbsp;Only one exam in there so far - 99.<br />
<br />
I'm still on track to get an A in both classes (my goal from the start), but I'm not done, yet. &nbsp;The lightened workload during Spring Break will give me some time to recharge my batteries and get ready to tackle the second half of the semester head-on.<br />
<br />
Aside from the happenings with Google, things are still going well at Fleming's. &nbsp;I finished training for dinner serving, and I've had a few shifts here and there, but I mostly still backwait at night and serve at lunch. &nbsp;I'm not in any rush to get away from backwaiting. &nbsp;I'm happy to offer multiple skills to help make scheduling easier.<br />
<br />
On a side note, we've put down a deposit on a date and venue for the wedding, and we're almost done narrowing down our guest list. &nbsp;It's gonna be in early October of this year, and we are thrilled to finally have an actual date to look forward to.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Finally, I'd like to talk about my plans for the next few months, with regards to beginning my journey into a new career, in tech. &nbsp;I plan to continue taking math classes and CS classes every semester until I have a job. &nbsp;Thus, I don't need to spend my free time learning to code, so much as I need to spend it making sure I'm on the right track and am setting realistic, but consistently challenging and appropriate career goals.<br />
<br />
Now that I've finished training at work, settled into the groove with my weekly schedule, and learned enough through class and independent research to have a pretty good idea of what the tech field currently looks like, my next goal is to learn more about each career track separately, so that I can eventually narrow down my path to just the few that I think would be the best fit for me. &nbsp;After that, I'll do some research as to what education options OTHER than a bachelor's degree at UT are available - don't want to put all my eggs in one basket, after all. &nbsp;Then, finally, with all the data I will have collected at that point, I'll make some big decisions as to how and where I should be devoting my time and energy, and what I want to be doing after I finish my education.<br />
<br />
It's an exciting time, I know, but I have to admit that I am STILL yearning to be in a position where I don't have to worry about WHAT I'm doing, but only HOW WELL I can do it.<br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />
<br />
still dreaming...
