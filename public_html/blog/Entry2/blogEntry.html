<i>"Show me two job-hunters. &nbsp;Both have been out of work for the same amount of time. &nbsp;Both are struggling... &nbsp;One is quietly smoldering with anger, barely suppressed. &nbsp;He is mad at the universe, and in no particular order, his former employer, his former co-workers, the government, politicians, his profession, his college, and his friends. &nbsp;He is very quiet, doesn't talk much, and when he does talk, it is to complain about how his life has turned out... &nbsp;The other is just as depressed about how his life has turned out, thus far, but he wakes up each morning glad to see the sun, puts on beautiful music, counts his blessings, spends each new day trying to be a better person than he was the day before, essentially sees life as an adventure, and is willing to wait patiently for his next Act to unfold."</i></div>

Considered by TIME Magazine to be one of the 100 most influential nonfiction books of the last century, this book is noteworthy not only because of the number of copies that have been sold, but also because of the number of editions in print. &nbsp;Since 1975, Richard N. Bolles has re-conceived and re-written the book once per year in order to keep up with the ever-evolving job market.<br />
<br />
"What Color is Your Parachute" is one of three books that I recently bought. &nbsp;Here are the other two:<br />

<br />
These three books perfectly encapsulate my current life goals: I want a new career, but I need to do some research in order to figure out what job is best for me. <br />
<br />
As you can see from the post-it notes in the Occupational Outlook Handbook, I've already given myself a head-start. &nbsp;After some preliminary research and good, old-fashioned soul-searching, I scanned through the massive book and was able to confidently eliminate the vast majority of the job market, narrowing my search down to a few jobs that truly appeal to my personality and interests. &nbsp;And, the best part? &nbsp;Almost all of these jobs conveniently fit into three categories:<br />
<br />
1) Engineering fields<br />
<br />
There are a great number of jobs that fall underneath the heading of "engineer", and I don't claim to know very much about any of them. &nbsp;However, from the brief descriptions of each that I read in the OOH, industrial engineering and civil engineering seem to appeal the most to me. &nbsp;I need to learn more to be sure of that judgment.<br />
<br />
2) Business/finance jobs<br />
<br />
In terms of "does this job fit my personality and interests?", the position of accountant has always felt like it would be a comfy one. &nbsp;It seems to lack the challenge of certain careers in the other two fields, but I'm not yet sure if I see that as a good or a bad thing. &nbsp;(or if it's even true!)<br />
<br />
3) Computers<br />
<br />
I use the broad term "computers" because my eyes have only recently been opened to the potential (non-monetary) rewards of being proficient at certain jobs in this field, and I don't want to narrow down my options too hastily. &nbsp;I feel like, after a good bit of research, my preference could range anywhere from the realm of computer programming, software design, and web design, all the way to people who make hardware or maintain equipment.<br />
<br />
(There are a few other jobs that interest me, but they currently feel like long-shots compared to the jobs in the above three categories. &nbsp;If any of the "others" start to interest me more keenly, I'll be sure to mention them.)<br />
<br />
With this blog, I will be following my progress in the search for a new career, all the way from the first steps (now) to the last steps - blisters, broken nails, and all - so that you may learn something, either about me, the job market, the skills I study, or (hopefully) yourself.<br />
<br />
So, what progress have I made so far?<br />
<br />
At the end of each blog entry, I will record my progress in each item that I'm currently working on. &nbsp;For now, only books are listed, but I may eventually work on different things, such as learning to use new computer programs, creating computer programs of my own, and - eventually - taking college courses!<br />
<br />
That's all for today!<br />
