<br />
Now that my career path is more clearly defined and the topics I'm studying are becoming more and more esoteric, a difficult question comes to mind regarding this blog. &nbsp;Do I continue to write in a way that can be understood by people without a background in my field, or should I embrace the jargon that I'm learning? &nbsp;I want to demonstrate my newfound knowledge, but I also want anyone to be able to read. &nbsp;What's a blogger to do?<br />
<br />
After contemplating this quandary, I decided to continue to write in a way that is accessible to all. &nbsp;If I eventually decide to start up a second, more specialized, blog - or, perhaps, a website, as I will briefly discuss later in this entry - I will post a link to it here, for those interested. &nbsp;For now, however, I'll be sticking with aMaCaDaD, and I'll be writing in a way that even the most computer-ignorant can follow.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
When I first started to learn to code, a few months ago, I began with a programming language called REALBasic. &nbsp;This language was designed to be easily accessible to beginners, which, at the time, seemed like a good thing. &nbsp;However, when I started to look deeper into the world of programming, I learned that I would eventually need to learn a more complex and popular language. &nbsp;I decided to change course and restart my coding education with what is currently the most popular programming language: C++. &nbsp;I bought "C++ Primer Plus" by Stephen Prata, and I got to work.<br />

<br />
<br />
Thankfully, this book is well-written and (so far) easy to follow. &nbsp;I've finished the first two chapters, and I feel like I have a firm grasp on some fundamental concepts.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't know what a programming language is, exactly, allow me to explain:<br />
<br />
Computers are the most loyal machines on the planet, but they are also the stupidest. &nbsp;They will do whatever you tell them to do, but they can't make decisions for themselves; you have to tell them, explicitly, what you want. <br />
<br />
In the real world, if you wanted somebody to take out the trash, you would simply say, "Would you mind taking out the trash?" &nbsp;On the other hand, if you wanted a computer to take out the trash, your instructions would have to be something like "Walk to the trash can. &nbsp;Remove the bag. &nbsp;Tie the bag. &nbsp;Walk to the front door. &nbsp;Open the door. &nbsp;Walk to the dumpster. &nbsp;Open the dumpster. &nbsp;Insert the trash into the dumpster. &nbsp;Walk back inside. &nbsp;Retrieve a new bag. &nbsp;Open the bag. &nbsp;Put the new bag in the trash can." &nbsp;You could rest assured that the trash would be taken out exactly the way that you described, but only after you devised the overly-specific instructions.<br />
<br />
This is the essence of programming. &nbsp;You think of a specific task, and then you come up with a way to explain exactly how you want the task to be performed, using a language that was created specifically for computers. &nbsp;The process of writing code can be tedious, time-consuming, and sometimes frustrating (one mistake can make an entire program inoperable), but once you get a program that works, your computer can perform your task far more efficiently than any human ever could.<br />

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>Some basic C++ code</i></span></div>
<br />
So far, I've learned the basic building blocks of a C++ program: &nbsp;Header files, standard namespaces, cout/cin, functions and their prototypes, variables, data types, classes, objects, keywords, return statements, and various formatting details. &nbsp;The review and exercises at the end of the second chapter reinforced what I learned, and I'm ready to take a bite out of some more advanced concepts.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
In addition to C++, I'd like to eventually get my feet wet in the world of web design. &nbsp;When I apply to colleges at the end of 2013, I want to have a portfolio with some programs and websites that I've created, to show that I mean business. &nbsp;I've already had an idea for my first online project: a website to promote awareness of the Montessori teaching method.<br />
<br />
For those of you who don't know anything of my personal life, allow me to explain why I've chosen this. &nbsp;My girlfriend is a Montessori guide, and she is very passionate about her work. &nbsp;She yearns for the public to be better educated on the teachings of Montessori, and for good reason. &nbsp;Maria Montessori was a brilliant woman, and she changed the world with her findings on early childhood education. &nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montessori_education" class="normalLink">Here is a link to the Wikipedia page on the Montessori teaching method.</a><br />
<br />
The reason I'm excited about the idea of creating such a website is because it helps both of us at the same time. &nbsp;It helps boost my resume because I will have built on my own, and it helps boost her resume because she will provide all of the actual content. &nbsp;It's also for a great cause that we both feel passionately about.<br />
<br />
At this point, it's nothing more than an idea, but she and I agree that it's a good idea. &nbsp;Hopefully, eventually, that idea will come to fruition.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
I put a hold on looking at schools so that I could focus on learning C++, but before I did, I learned two unfortunate truths about the financial side of college. &nbsp;First off, non-borrowed financial aid is going to be nigh-impossible to earn for my second bachelor's degree. &nbsp;For example, pell grants aren't given to second-attempt students, regardless of financial status. &nbsp;Additionally, the school-awarded scholarships/fellowships/aid are usually given to traditional students, because, well, I've already had my chance.<br />
<br />
The second thing that I learned was the importance of in-state tuition. &nbsp;Admittedly, I didn't realize this before, as my first bachelor's degree was at a college from the same state as my high school, and I had a teaching assistantship at grad school which covered my tuition there. &nbsp;However, now, the difference in out-of-state and in-state tuition could easily be the difference between my being able to attend a school and not being able to attend a school.<br />
<br />
Learning these two things made me a little pessimistic, but I reminded myself that I had many things to be optimistic about. &nbsp;I may not have as easy a time paying for college as I did the first time through, but my confidence in my ability to "nail it" and find a job the moment I finish is definitely higher than when I was 18. &nbsp;Additionally, I don't have as much debt as many other college graduates, so I can afford to take out some loans. &nbsp;Finally, I have a girlfriend and a family that support me; this is more important than anything else.<br />

More C++ on the way. &nbsp;Stay tuned!<br />
