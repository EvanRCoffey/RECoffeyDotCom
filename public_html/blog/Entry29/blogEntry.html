			Hello again!<br />
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<div>
			Demo day for the October cohort of The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin is in the books, which means I'm officially done with the program! &nbsp;It was a lot of fun, I learned a ton, and I met some great people, many of whom I see as peers and intend to keep in touch with.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<div>
			The boot camp's end, of course, marks a change in strategy for me. &nbsp;Instead of remaining a "sponge", without any particular direction outside of the curriculum of the course, I am now compelled to select a specialization. &nbsp;Thankfully, I've done so, and that specialization is admittedly still pretty general, though less so than before. &nbsp;To begin my career, I will work as a front-end developer.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
			<a href="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wihc8NpI4uc/WRN6QBYn-VI/AAAAAAAAAXE/LIrsEJWMcyAPBCEQXmxA8V6BnDo7SymNgCLcB/s1600/Front-End-Developers-3.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="203" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Wihc8NpI4uc/WRN6QBYn-VI/AAAAAAAAAXE/LIrsEJWMcyAPBCEQXmxA8V6BnDo7SymNgCLcB/s400/Front-End-Developers-3.png" width="400" /></a></div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<div>
			While the boot camp was advertised as a full-stack program, the truth of the matter is that much more focus was placed on front-end technologies than back end ones. &nbsp;Additionally, the barrier to entry for back-end jobs is higher. &nbsp;Thus, while I do think I have the capacity to make a great back-end developer, it will have to be later, rather than sooner.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<div>
			After making that decision, it quickly became clear where I'll be spending my programming hours over the coming days and weeks. &nbsp;Whether through building on an existing project or by starting something new, I'm going to do my darnedest to learn React.js. &nbsp;It's a pretty hot technology that I enjoy using, and even if the job I get doesn't use it, specifically, it will likely use something very similar.</div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
			<a href="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BcAHJQ5Tdjc/WRN6c8qub-I/AAAAAAAAAXI/yjMIjR_Hjco5oDm06XqEenDIo-JfrRiZwCLcB/s1600/reactjs.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-BcAHJQ5Tdjc/WRN6c8qub-I/AAAAAAAAAXI/yjMIjR_Hjco5oDm06XqEenDIo-JfrRiZwCLcB/s400/reactjs.png" width="400" /></a></div>
			<div>
			<br /></div>
			<div>
			So, there it is! &nbsp;I now know what my niche is and am learning to embrace it. &nbsp;Instead of trying to be good at everything, I will try to be great at a few things. &nbsp;Here's hoping that strategy will land me a job where I can prove my worth.</div>
