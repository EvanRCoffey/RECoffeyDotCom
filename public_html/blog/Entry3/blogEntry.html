<i>"If you want to have a job in IT, the military is the way to go."</i></div>
<br />
Last night, I had the privilege of hanging out with an old friend of mine from college named Jay. &nbsp;Being that he's a few years my senior, I see Jay as half father-figure, half friend. &nbsp;Husband and father of 3, he's a well-rounded guy who has made a great life for himself, so I was anxious to ask him about his career in IT.<br />
<br />
When he explained his job to me, it sounded attractive in so many ways - great money, low stress, long-term job security, etc. &nbsp;Then, when I asked him how one might go about getting such a job, his answer was something I had never even considered for myself:<br />
<br />
The military.<br />
<br />
The military!<br />
<br />
Having listened to Jay rave about the benefits of being in the military, the fact that I have never considered it suddenly seems so strange. &nbsp;After all, my parents met in the Navy, two of my grandparents served in the Air Force, and several of my friends from high school that joined the military have made great careers for themselves. &nbsp;Why, then, has the thought of trying it for myself never crossed my mind? &nbsp;Perhaps it's the fact that the only military jobs in my original career path (music) were extremely difficult to come by. &nbsp;Perhaps it's my fear of ending up in combat. &nbsp;Perhaps it's the fact that I've watched Full Metal Jacket too many times. &nbsp;I don't really know. &nbsp;What I do know, now, though, is that I am adding it to my ever-growing list of options for the future.<br />
<br />

In my last entry, I broke down the jobs that interested me into three categories - Engineering, Business/Finance, and Computers. &nbsp;Since then, I have spent more time learning about Computers than the other two.<br />
<br />
I watched a short documentary on Youtube about the history of computers, and I found it downright fascinating. &nbsp;It's not exactly the most polished or up-to-date video, but the content felt accurate and legitimate.<br />
<br />

<br />
I also ordered "Beginning computer programming for dummies", which should be arriving in the mail soon. <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Programming-Dummies-Wallace-Wang/dp/0470088702/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363729725&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=beginning+programming+for+dummies">http://www.amazon.com/Beginning-Programming-Dummies-Wallace-Wang/dp/0470088702/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363729725&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=beginning+programming+for+dummies</a><br />
<br />
Once I finish my beginner's guide, I plan to move forward by learning a specific programming language more thoroughly. &nbsp;Hopefully, the guide will give me an idea as to which language is best for me.<br />
<br />

<br />
After reading my first two entries, it occurred to me that it might not be clear than I <b>am</b> currently employed. &nbsp;Allow me to clarify: I work at a fine dining restaurant in southern California. &nbsp;It's a good job, and I'm happy to have it.<br />
<br />
Rest assured, I will not be using this blog to bore you with the minutiae of my everyday life; you've got enough boring minutiae of your own to worry about. &nbsp;I just wanted to clear up the fact that I'm not actually unemployed, given that this is a blog about job hunting.<br />
<br />

<br />
Unfortunately, aside from completing the next chapter in my Algebra book, I haven't done any reading since my last entry. &nbsp;However, I will have a bit more free time this week than I did last week, so I plan on making up for lost time. &nbsp;Next up on my to-do list is to complete the centerpiece of "What Color is Your Parachute": a 75+ page self-inventory called "The Flower Exercise", intended to help me "understand more fully who I am." &nbsp;I will be writing a blog entry devoted entirely to my findings.<br />
