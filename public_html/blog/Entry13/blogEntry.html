	October 20th, 2014 - Time To Whip Out My Handy Dandy Calculator!
</div>

Hello, world!<br />
<br />
The last time we spoke, I was wading through a shallow sea of paperwork. &nbsp;Now, I've made it to shore, but I'm still soaking wet.<br />
<br />
Paperwork is boring, so I won't talk about it, save for one particular document: the dreaded Preparatory Coursework Agreement. <br />
<br />
Being that I already have a bachelor's degree, I have to submit certain documentation to prove that I'm not taking classes simply to raise my GPA or further delay paying off student loans, and that I am, in fact, trying to get another degree. &nbsp;One way of proving this is to declare a major, then fill out a Preparatory Coursework Agreement to prove that there is a 4-year university in the state of Texas that offers a degree I am trying to eventually acquire, and that x, y, and z classes are required for said degree. &nbsp;Easy enough, right? &nbsp;Fill-in-the-blank type stuff.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, getting it signed by an advisor at said 4-year university proved much harder than filling it out. &nbsp;The process involved way too many phone calls, several trips to various campuses, and being turned away by three separate departments at UT. &nbsp;Thankfully, a fourth department finally had an advisor with 5 minutes to spare to speak with me. &nbsp;She actually gave me about 30, and was a compassionate, helpful woman. &nbsp;Faith in academia reinvigorated. &nbsp;Priority deadline for financial aid at ACC, met.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Another piece of good news: I was accepted into the Honors College at ACC! &nbsp;It will allow me to access Honors versions of my classes, with smaller class sizes better suited for discussions. &nbsp;I enjoyed the Honors courses during my first bachelor's degree; I'm happy to get the same opportunity, here.<br />
<br />
So, what's up next, then? &nbsp; Well, the two remaining deadlines for me are both under a month away: first, the ACC general scholarship form priority deadline, then shortly after that, open registration for the Spring 2015 semester. <br />
<br />
The reason I consider registration a deadline is because I need to make a sufficient score on the ACT Compass exam in order to skip Trigonometry and Pre-Calculus and sign up for Calculus 1, and I want to have done so by the time registration opens so that I can get the professor and weekly schedule I want.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping to take the test no more than twice: once, a week from now, and then again, three weeks after that. &nbsp;I don't expect to score well on the first attempt; I'm mostly taking it to get hands-on experience with the test and to see how much work I need to do to achieve a sufficient score.<br />
<br />
As I mentioned in my previous entry, I took Algebra, Trigonometry, Pre-Calculus, and Calculus in high school, then Algebra again in college. &nbsp;Thus, the next month will be more of a refresher than a crash-course. &nbsp;I've already watched a couple of youtube videos to jog my memory about trigonometry, and if you go way back to the first few entries of this blog, you'll see that I already got a head start on re-learning algebra last year, in California. &nbsp;I'm hoping a month is all I need, now. &nbsp;We'll see.<br />
<br />
As for the scholarship application: as soon as I get the letters of recommendation that two of my friends graciously offered to write for me, I'll update my resume, write a brief essay, fill out and submit the form, and cross my fingers.<br />

<br />
<br />
Hopefully, by the time Thanksgiving gets here, I'll have everything out of the way, be registered for classes, and have a head start on the Spring semester. &nbsp;Until then, I'll be working, studying, and, of course, dreaming...
