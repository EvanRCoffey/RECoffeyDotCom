				November 11th, 2014 - No calculators?  No problem.
			</div>

			Hello, world!<br />
			<br />
			In my last entry, I mentioned two imminent deadlines. &nbsp;I'm happy to say I met both of them!<br />
			<br />
			<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
			<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BIjpxFnOtOA/VGuQFetMyrI/AAAAAAAAAKI/OGCCz5dpUYc/s1600/YES_cat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-BIjpxFnOtOA/VGuQFetMyrI/AAAAAAAAAKI/OGCCz5dpUYc/s1600/YES_cat.jpg" width="242" /></a></div>

			<br />
			The first was easy - the general scholarship application for Austin Community College. &nbsp;After I collected my letters of recommendation, I just had a few forms to fill out and a short essay to write, and I was done. &nbsp;I get my results some time in December.<br />
			<br />
			The second one was a bit trickier - the COMPASS math exam. &nbsp;I could attempt the test as many times as necessary at the cost of $10 - and 2 hours - per test, but I needed the following scores, all in one attempt, in order to skip trig/pre-cal and start in Calculus 1:<br />
			<br />
			Algebra - 85 of 99<br />
			College Algebra - 80 of 99<br />
			Trigonometry - 80 of 99<br />
			<br />
			My first attempt earned me scores of 86 in Algebra, 75 in College Algebra, and 86 in Trigonometry. &nbsp;Close, but no cigar, so I studied my algebra book over the following week and then tried it again, strangely receiving scores of 99, 67, and 79. &nbsp;Algebra went up, College Algebra down? &nbsp;Finally, I downloaded a real college algebra final exam that I found using Google, wrote down the concepts unfamiliar to me, studied those<span style="text-align: center;">, then went back and finally passed with scores of 99, 89, and 82, just 3 days before open registration.</span><br />
			<br />
			Then, at 12:01 AM on November 17th, I registered for Calculus I and Progamming Fundamentals I.<br />
			<br />
			It's happening! &nbsp;It's finally happening!<br />
			<br />
			Class starts January 20th. &nbsp;I can hardly wait.<br />

			I don't usually talk about my current jobs, but the last few weeks have been pretty eventful in that department. &nbsp;In addition to two very busy, stressful weeks at my night job, Fleming's, I actually gave my 3 week's notice and subsequently finished up at my day job, Westwood Country Club. &nbsp;Juggling those, plus studying for and taking the exams, has been draining, but I'm glad to be done with it.<br />
			<br />
			Now, I'm still working nights at Fleming's, but I'm leaving my days free until class starts. &nbsp;Then, shortly thereafter, Fleming's will open for lunch. &nbsp;Westwood was necessary for me at first, but now that I've found my footing, the extra time is more valuable than the extra paychecks. &nbsp;I'm taking advantage of the open schedule while I can. &nbsp;I may even take my flabby self down to the gym!<br />

			I'll be spending a few days with family this Thanksgiving, which I'm very, well, thankful for. &nbsp;To be honest, I'm not sure how much I'll blog between now and January 20th. &nbsp;I think, if something comes up, I'll chime in, but otherwise, I'll just be handling my business and getting ready for this exciting new chapter.<br />
			<br />
			Still dreaming...
