	March 12th, 2017 - Gunning For That Number One Spot
</div>

Hello again from <strike>pollen-covered</strike> sunny Austin, TX. &nbsp;Spring is here, and thank goodness for that! &nbsp;I'm ready for shorts weather.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

Life since my last update has been filled with code - lots and lots of code. &nbsp;For a few weeks, my time was divided between boot camp homework assignments, mine and my wife's websites, and learning some tricky new back-end concepts. &nbsp;Then, about 3 weeks ago, I started work on a website that my coding buddy and I ended up using for this weekend's group project assignment. &nbsp;It's a restaurant server/bartender companion that helps with organizing finances, studying menus, and managing goals. &nbsp;I had the idea a little over a year ago; originally, I planned to write it as an offline app, but I think it is much more useful as an internet-based app. &nbsp;It's still in a beta test, so I don't yet want to publicize the domain name. &nbsp;However, it's nearly done. &nbsp;Just a few bugs needs fixing before it's ready to be used by the public. &nbsp;I'm proud of the work we've done on it, and I can't wait until it's ready to show off.<br />
<br />
With the near completion of this project, plus the impending completion of the boot camp, I am engaged full-throttle in the hunt for a full-time web developer job. &nbsp;I do indeed feel ready to write salary-worthy code, so I'm not waiting until the end of the program to apply; I'm starting now. &nbsp;My plan is to advertise for freelance work while looking for a full-time job in or near Austin. &nbsp;If I get a job, I'll remove the advertisements. &nbsp;If I get what I feel is a full-time schedule's worth of freelance opportunities, I'll pull back on applying for jobs. &nbsp;Either way, after the last few months and, especially, these last few weeks, I feel prepared to take on a wide range of programming tasks.<br />

I'll check back in again when I get news. &nbsp;Hopefully, it'll be good news :)<br />
