Hello again! &nbsp;It's gotten a bit chilly lately, here in Austin. &nbsp;I'm glad to be inside, blogging, where it's warm.<br />
<br />
In my last entry, I mentioned that I had an eventful month ahead of me. &nbsp;That month (December) is over, and now I'm halfway into January. &nbsp;Since my last entry, I have graduated from Austin Community College with my A.S. in Computer Science, I worked my last shift at Fleming's, and I visited family for 12 days straight for the holidays. &nbsp;Now, I'm back in Austin and I'm finally focused on web development.<br />

<br />
The Coding Boot Camp at UT Austin has turned out to be a challenge that happens to be a lot of fun. &nbsp;I've learned so much already, and I'm only about halfway done. &nbsp;We spent the first 1/3 or so of the class covering the front end - HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Bootstrap, AJAX/API/JSON, plus a few others. &nbsp;Then, we spent a few weeks on group projects.<br />
<br />
The group project was a great learning experience. &nbsp;We broke into groups of 3-5 that had to build a website from the ground up. &nbsp;We only had a few requirements - the rest was totally up to us. &nbsp;It was great learning how to work with a team to build a product that everyone was satisfied with. &nbsp;It was even better seeing all of the fantastic ideas everyone came up with.<br />
<br />
Our group ended up working on a website which takes API data from three different services to allow you to search your area for fun things to do. &nbsp;It's like a watered-down version of Eventful. &nbsp;We had a small group of 3 people, and I was home for the holidays for much of our break, but we still managed to get a finished product together in time. &nbsp;I've since tweaked it a bit to fit my preferences, and I've uploaded it here:<br />

<br />
I've also built myself a personal website.<br />

<br />
I've also built my wife a Montessori website.<br />

<br />
So! &nbsp;With Fleming's in the books and nothing other than the boot camp going on for me, I'm definitely looking for work. &nbsp;I can only work part time right now, but once April gets here, I'll be ready for full time. &nbsp;I've already started applying. &nbsp;I'll also be advertising on social media soon to help friends build/improve their own personal websites. &nbsp;I'm hoping to start getting busy as a web developer, in one fashion or another, as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
One last thing: &nbsp;We got a second cat. &nbsp;Her name is Leeloo, and she and Remy are already good friends.<br />
