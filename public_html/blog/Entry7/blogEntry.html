			<i>"You've already made up your mind. &nbsp;You just don't know it yet." - my girlfriend</i></div>
			<br />
			Surprise! &nbsp;It would appear I've fast-forwarded ten or so blog entries, as I recently decided that my future career will involve computers. &nbsp;Let me just say: I couldn't be happier with my decision.<br />
			<br />
			I know, I know, you're sorely disappointed. &nbsp;You wanted to read about me laboriously sifting through different career options, tediously eliminating one at a time. &nbsp;Well, I'm sorry to disappoint you, but after some conversations with loved ones, I realized that I already knew what I wanted to do; I was just afraid to admit it to myself. &nbsp;So, computers it is!<br />
			<br />
			So...<br />
			<br />
			Now what?<br />
			<br />
			Well, to say I have a long journey ahead of me would be an egregious understatement. &nbsp;Being that my education since high school has been almost completely focused on music, I have quite a bit to learn in order to make this career change happen successfully. &nbsp;However, now that I have clear direction, this lack of knowledge feels much less intimidating than before.<br />
			<br />
			In order to remain focused and level-headed, I went ahead and made myself a timeline for the next few years. &nbsp;It's entirely possible that this timeline will change, but I wanted to make it feel as concrete as possible.<br />
			<br />
			1) Now -&gt; Winter 2013<br />
			<br />
			Undergraduate admissions deadlines for the 2014-2015 academic year are set for the winter months: December, January, February. &nbsp;This is my first "target" window.<br />
			<br />
			As I mentioned above, I don't have much in the way of a computer-focused resume/portfolio. &nbsp;Thus, between now and winter, my primary goal is to make myself as attractive as possible to universities. &nbsp;I want to learn code well enough to create programs/websites that I can submit with my applications, and I also want to become somewhat knowledgeable about other areas of computer science, such as networks, hardware, history, and upper-level math. &nbsp;Hopefully, all of this work will not only increase my chances of getting into a good school, but it will help me to earn better financial aid, as well as getting me excited about the subject matter.<br />
			<br />
			I already found out what some of the better colleges in the country for computer science are. &nbsp;I looked at five different "best computer science degrees" lists, and I compiled the data into a small spreadsheet:<br />
			<br />
			<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
			<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XSVBMvf-eOE/UY1RNF8xU4I/AAAAAAAAADQ/qmOKzyIOEh4/s1600/spreadsheet.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="161" src="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-XSVBMvf-eOE/UY1RNF8xU4I/AAAAAAAAADQ/qmOKzyIOEh4/s640/spreadsheet.png" width="640" /></a></div>
			<br />
			<br />
			Obviously, there are far more options than those listed above, but I thought it'd be good to familiarize myself with "the best" before I started looking at "the rest".<br />
			<br />
			2) Winter 2013 -&gt; Summer 2014<br />
			<br />
			Once I've applied to the colleges, I will be doing two things: applying for extra financial aid and planning my move. &nbsp;This probably goes without saying, given my current line of work, but I don't make very much money right now, so planning these two things as thoroughly as I can will be vital to my success. <br />
			<br />
			I will also continue to educate myself during this time. &nbsp;When I show up to college, I want to have a head start.<br />
			<br />
			3) Fall 2014 -&gt; Spring 2017<br />
			<br />
			I want to graduate in no more than three years. &nbsp;I already have a bachelor's degree, so I'm hoping that some of my credits will transfer. &nbsp;Additionally, I intend to take a full-time courseload every semester, even if it means that I have to take out a significant amount of money in student loans. &nbsp;Luckily, I had an abundance of scholarships and grants for my first trip through college, so I can afford to take out loans this time if I need to.<br />
			<br />
			During the summer semesters, I'm going to try as hard as I possibly can to score internships and part-time work related to my field. &nbsp;Again, I feel that I need to overcompensate for the fact that the first 26 years of my life had nothing to do with computers; I don't want employers to wonder if I'm as committed to this overhaul of interests as I claim I am.<br />
			<br />
			4) Summer 2017<br />
			<br />
			Booya! &nbsp;Time to get to work!<br />
			<br />
			***<br />
			<br />
			So, that's the plan, for now. &nbsp;I'm truly excited about all of the things I'll be learning in the next few months, and I look forward to sharing them with you along the way.<br />
			<br />
			***<br />
			<br />
			A note on the job hunt:<br />
			<br />
			I applied to a handful of local restaurants, even getting interviews at two of them. &nbsp;Unfortunately, however, I'm still working at the same job as before. &nbsp;Luckily, some of the problems that I had with this job have gone away, the most important of which is that I am now being scheduled enough shifts to comfortably pay my bills. &nbsp;I still feel like there is a better job for me out there, somewhere, so I am still looking. &nbsp;I'm just not looking as actively as before, as my lifestyle, for the moment, is at least "acceptable".<br />
			<br />
			***<br />
			<br />
			Given recent developments, it's fitting that my blog should be titled "A Man, A <u>Computer</u>, A Desk, A Dream". &nbsp;Now that I've decided what my goals are for the future, I feel like I'm one step closer to turning that dream into a reality.<br />
