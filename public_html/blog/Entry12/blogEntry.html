Hello, world!<br />
<br />
As you can see, I am returning to the written format for this entry. &nbsp;Vlogging was fun to try, but I think I express myself better through writing. &nbsp;That, and I have very large ears. &nbsp;Expect most, if not all, future entries to be earless.<br />

Lesley and I are fighting the good fight here in the Autumn months of Austin. &nbsp;We still have the same jobs, and we’ve settled in quite nicely since the move. &nbsp;I even managed to get a recurring weekly schedule that always has one of my off days falling on the weekend. &nbsp;It can be hard to lock that in, working full time in the restaurant industry; I’m glad I did, so that we can finally plan fun things to do together. &nbsp;So far, we’ve visited the Capitol (everything really IS bigger in Texas), eaten at several killer Tex-Mex restaurants (fried bacon-wrapped stuffed avocado – yes, really), and, of course, had several lazy days and nights at home.<br />
<br />
Speaking of lazy, I’ve been on an errand-spree as of late. &nbsp;It would appear that I am, in fact, on track to begin classes at Austin Community College for the Spring 2015 semester! &nbsp;I’ve got a few tasks I’m working on right now, but before I get to those, let me tell you about how the adventure began...<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TGPADKcu5yE/VDgRAsZpvdI/AAAAAAAAAHc/6xJpeWstu1k/s1600/bill-mellinda-gates-computer-science-complex08.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="220" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-TGPADKcu5yE/VDgRAsZpvdI/AAAAAAAAAHc/6xJpeWstu1k/s1600/bill-mellinda-gates-computer-science-complex08.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>

<span style="font-size: x-small;"><b>The Bill and Melinda Gates Computer Science Hall at UT Austin</b></span></div>
<br />
A month or so ago, I decided to take a walk around the computer science building at UT to have a look-see. &nbsp;I fantasized of aimlessly meandering the halls until I stumbled through an open office door to find a woman in a suit, saying “Hello, Evan. &nbsp;I’ve been expecting you. &nbsp;Please have a seat and let me answer all of your questions.” &nbsp;Unfortunately, the reality of the situation was quite different. &nbsp;Every inviting room, flier, or office was for UT CS students only. &nbsp;All I got for my time was a business card and a polite, but quite clear, cessation of eye contact from a receptionist ready to return to whatever it is receptionists would rather be doing.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, the business card proved useful. &nbsp;I emailed my questions to the address on the card, and within hours received answers not only to all of them, but to others I hadn’t yet thought of but should have (Thank you, guy who emailed me!). &nbsp;After browsing several of the internet resources to which I had been directed, I decided to just go ahead and start answering as many questions as I could on my own. &nbsp;That, and to go to an ACC (Austin Community College) campus to speak with an advisor.<br />
<br />
The trip to the advisor skyrocketed me forward. &nbsp;All of a sudden, I was simultaneously going through the ACC application process, speaking with a CS professor at ACC, speaking with a transfer advisor at UT, ordering transcripts, filling out paperwork, planning for financial aid, planning for a math exemption exam, whistling the Andy Griffith Show theme song with six jumbo marshmallows in my mouth, and juggling three chainsaws.<br />
<br />
Things I learned from accomplishing these tasks:<br />
<br />
1) From the mouth of a CS professor, getting a bachelor's degree in CS is, in fact, a good way to accomplish my goals.<br />
<br />
2) I have reason to be optimistic, but not yet reason to be sure, that about 30-40 credits from my first bachelor’s degree will transfer to my second, should I be accepted at UT.<br />
<br />
3) The financial aid process this go-around is going to be a little more complicated, and less lucrative, than the first.<br />
<br />
4) I need to re-learn trigonometry and pre-calculus for the math exemption exam in less than 2 months in order to take Calculus 1 in the Spring (I took all three in high school).<br />
<br />
5) Marshmallows are delicious but not conducive to proper whistling technique.<br />
<br />
6) Juggling chainsaws is super easy, I don't understand why people are so impressed by it.<br />
<br />
After taking care of some necessary tasks and returning to the advisor, I am now just one test, a few essays, and a little more paperwork away from being ready for a 9-credit courseload next semester. &nbsp;Ideally, I'll be taking Calculus 1, Intro to CS, and US History 1.<br />
<br />
The test will involve some studying, of course, and the essays/paperwork some time, but I currently feel optimistic that everything will fall into place and that I will be able to get this party started in less than 2 months time. &nbsp;To say I'm excited would be an understatement.<br />
<br />

<br />
So, until next time, expect me to be learning how to measure triangles and use proofs and stuff, and taking my 27-year old butt out there into the world of academia and shaking it for admissions staff members.<br />
<br />
(And to my Facebook friends, welcome! &nbsp;Hope you enjoy reading.)<br />
<br />
Still dreaming...
