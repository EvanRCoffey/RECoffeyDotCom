<span style="font-size: x-small;"><i>A rare photo of the elusive "floating in mid-air" computer programmer</i></span></div>
<br />
In my previous entry, I detailed plans to explore careers involving computers. &nbsp;While I have devoted a good bit of time to that, I have also been slightly distracted by a handful of other things - namely, a book on engineering that my mother bought for me, and my hunt for a new restaurant job. &nbsp;Because of this, today's entry lacks the focus I was hoping for, and for that, I do apologize. &nbsp;However, it's been a week and a half since my last entry, and I wanted to check in.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
First things first: the job hunt. &nbsp;Before I started my research on local restaurants, I went ahead and applied to one about a mile from my house that I was pretty sure would be a good fit. &nbsp;Luckily, using the job-hunting skills I recently learned about in "What Color is Your Parachute", I scored an interview within a few days. &nbsp;The interview went well, and I was told that I'd be contacted "soon" for a second interview. &nbsp;While I waited for the phone call, I finished my research, "just in case", but I didn't actually apply to any more places. &nbsp;Unfortunately, since then (7 days ago), the second interview I was promised has still not yet been scheduled.<br />
<br />
I don't think I've been forgotten, as I've been told multiple times by multiple people that they're going through a transition between managers and they're momentarily "spread thin". &nbsp;However, I can't afford to sit idly and wait. &nbsp;My patience is wearing thin, but I'm going to wait another day or two to call them one final time and insist on action being taken. &nbsp;If they can't accommodate that, I'm going to forget about them and start applying to the other restaurants.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
Before I get to my findings on computers, I'd like to first talk about a book called "Is There an Engineer Inside You?" by Celeste Baine.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cIHIM2Nf3g4/UXRKAfyuGDI/AAAAAAAAACs/8z7oQ4WouhI/s1600/is+there+an+engineer+inside+you.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-cIHIM2Nf3g4/UXRKAfyuGDI/AAAAAAAAACs/8z7oQ4WouhI/s320/is+there+an+engineer+inside+you.jpg" width="207" /></a></div>
<br />
Admittedly, I didn't read the entire book, as I found much of the content either irrelevant or redundant. &nbsp;However, I read enough to have a clearer picture of the differences between all of the engineering fields, which was the reason the book was given to me. &nbsp;After finishing, the two fields that interested me the most were the same two as before I started the book: Civil Engineering and Industrial Engineering.<br />
<br />
I still haven't researched these fields enough to share any real insight with you, but at least now, it's clear where my energy should be focused when I get to that point.<br />
<br />
***<br />
<br />
When I began my research on computers last week, the first thing I did was revisit the occupational outlook handbook. &nbsp;I compared and contrasted all of the different jobs within the field, and I found that a majority of the careers could be acquired with a bachelor's degree in Computer Science. &nbsp;This is good news, because if I decide that I want to go to school for a career in computers, I can do so without having to decide on a specialization until I've had time to figure out what area(s), specifically, would be the best for me.<br />
<br />
Since then, I've spent more time learning about programming than any other computer-related field, as it's what I know the least about. &nbsp;Luckily, after many hours of searching the internet for free, beginner-friendly, easy-to-follow instructions, I finally found what I was looking for: a "curriculum" provided by Real Studio, a compiler based on a programming language designed for beginners but used by experts, called BASIC. &nbsp;This was a great find, as "Beginning Computer Programming For Dummies" was not as helpful as I was hoping it would be, plus all of the other resources I found were confusing, out-of-date, or poorly written.<br />
<br />
The curriculum is 27 lessons long. &nbsp;I'm on lesson 5, right now. &nbsp;So far, I've learned about assignments, data types, conditionals, variables, loops, boolean expressions, debugging, and various Real Studio-specific language concepts. &nbsp;It's all very new and a little bit hard to crack, but I feel like I'm starting to "get it". &nbsp;And the best part? I think I might like it! &nbsp;I've been taking thorough notes and I'm confident I'll keep learning.<br />

<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it seems that a career in programming isn't all rainbows and butterflies. &nbsp;Several sources have mentioned that it's a notoriously stressful line of work, with many unrelenting deadlines and a burnout factor even higher than teaching preschool. &nbsp;I spoke with a friend of mine who used to be a software developer and is now a consultant. &nbsp;He said that this reputation is not far from the truth, and that you're often working for people with much more money than you but much less common sense. &nbsp;He said that it's not uncommon to be asked to change your work because of last-minute "great ideas", and that working within unforgiving confines (such as deadlines or lack of appropriate finances) is common. &nbsp;However, he also said that it's not always that way, and that, like most careers, it really just depends on the specific job that you get. &nbsp;I'm not going to let this information scare me away from the field, though. &nbsp;I'm just going to keep it in my back pocket. &nbsp;After all, it can't be that all programmers are unhappy, right?<br />
<br />

<br />
That's all for now. &nbsp;I'm hoping to have made significant progress on the curriculum and to have secured a new job by the time I write my next entry.<br />
