	August 6th, 2015 - Two Months Until the Wedding!
</div>

It's been just over 3 months since I last blogged. &nbsp;The summer has been relaxing but productive. &nbsp;I've learned about web development, made progress on wedding planning, done some research and thinking about the future, and kept up the good work at Fleming's. &nbsp;Now, Lesley's students have returned, and it's back to the routine. &nbsp;In two and a half weeks, I'll be back in class, too.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JmeEddMae00/VcOgXVsL-xI/AAAAAAAAANA/9-O6fi6-Cd0/s1600/Screen-shot-2012-08-27-at-9.56.57-AM.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="239" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JmeEddMae00/VcOgXVsL-xI/AAAAAAAAANA/9-O6fi6-Cd0/s320/Screen-shot-2012-08-27-at-9.56.57-AM.png" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
<br />
My web development "curriculum" is just about over. &nbsp;My goal for the summer was to finish tutorials on 4 web languages (HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP) and do some work on a couple of small websites. &nbsp;So far, I've finished tutorials on all of the languages save PHP, plus I've finished a (very simple) website for the wedding and gotten started on my personal, professional website. &nbsp;I hope to finish my "curriculum" before the start of the Fall semester.<br />
<br />
I see the web development skills I've learned over the summer as one more tool to add to my toolkit. &nbsp;Eventually, I want to be more specialized, but I still don't feel the time is right to do that - I want to learn a little about a lot of things before I learn a lot about one thing. &nbsp;So far, so good, but I must say I hope this period doesn't last too much longer - I really am ready to get to work.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The wedding! &nbsp;It's less than 2 months away, and I'm definitely getting excited. &nbsp;One by one, we've been crossing things off our to-do list, and we're very close to being done. &nbsp;Neither Lesley nor I enjoy being the center of attention, so we're not doing anything extravagant. &nbsp;Our ceremony will be small, intimate, and hopefully fun (NOT stressful!). &nbsp;We're getting married in Disney World and are staying there for our honeymoon.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Obviously, the wedding is the highlight and focus of the Fall semester. &nbsp;However, I'll also be getting work done! &nbsp;I'm already signed up for Programming Fundamentals II and Calculus II - I start on August 25th. &nbsp;I'm definitely ready to get back in the classroom. &nbsp;Additionally, I intend to return from the wedding ready to start job hunting. &nbsp;Hopefully, by the end of 2015, I will be able to convince somebody to give me a desk job. &nbsp;With those two things, plus work and class, I have a feeling I'll be pretty busy.<br />
<br />
Until then, I've got a few more things to do to wrap up the summer. &nbsp;We've officially crossed the one-year mark of being Texans (in-state tuition, baby!), but we've still got at least a few more left. &nbsp;Nose to the grindstone, and hopefully something will come of it. &nbsp;Until next time.<br />
