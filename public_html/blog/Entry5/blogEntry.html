<i>"Getting another, better job, ASAP, is going to do you so much good." - </i>A recent text message from a friend</div>
<br />
The "secret", I suppose, is out.<br />
<br />
Two entries ago, in this blog, I remarked about my current job: &nbsp;"I work at a fine dining restaurant in southern California. &nbsp;It's a good job, and I'm happy to have it."<br />
<br />
At the time, I wasn't sure what would come of the job, so I didn't want to project a negative attitude. &nbsp;However, now that I've decided that I'm going to be looking for a different job in the next few days, I don't mind admitting that it is *not* a good job and that I am *not* happy to have it.<br />
<br />
Why? &nbsp;Well, the short answer is that I don't make enough money. &nbsp;The longer answer is that I can't request days off, my schedule is different every week, I am constantly "on call" which makes it impossible to make plans, I'm not given enough shifts, I haven't been offered certain things I was promised when I was hired, I can only work at night, and I get paid less than my previous three jobs, despite being held to higher standards.<br />
<br />
Thus, within the next few days, I will be updating my restaurant-focused resume', putting on my Sunday Best, and trying to convince employers that I'm as good as I think I am at waiting tables.<br />
<br />
Do keep in mind, this blog is still focused on the "bigger picture". &nbsp;However, I felt that this particular episode of my life was worth mentioning. &nbsp;Hopefully, by the time I write my next entry, I will have good news, and I can get back to devoting my energy to my future, instead of being stuck in the present.<br />
<br />

<br />
Luckily, I finished "What Color Is Your Parachute" just in time for my job-hunt!<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, I wasn't quite as amazed by the second half of WCIYP as I was by the first half. &nbsp;After the "Flower Exercise", the book shifted gears a bit, focusing more on job acquisition than on self-reflection. &nbsp;Obviously, a book about job-acquisition needs to, at some point, talk about job-acquisition, so I'm not saying this shifting of gears is a fault. &nbsp;However, right now, I don't need to know much as much about salary negotiation or starting my own business as I do about making the right choices in the careers I'm exploring.<br />
<br />
That said, I read the book, cover to cover, and it will wait, nice and cozy, in my bookshelf, for the days that I DO need to think about salary negotiation or starting my own business. &nbsp;Plus, I get the bonus of being able to apply some of the information I learned to my "mini" job-hunt.<br />
<br />
The final verdict on "What Color Is Your Parachute?": Two thumbs up!<br />

<br />
So, what's the best thing about finishing WCIYP? &nbsp;Now, I can move on to the meat and potatoes of my research: the jobs, themselves. &nbsp;Allow me to explain my plan for the next few aMaCaDaD entries (aka, the next few weeks)...<br />
<br />
In essence, what I'm going to be doing is giving myself a series of "crash courses" in the career fields I've chosen. &nbsp;I hope to find out, at the very least, the following information about each of them:<br />
<br />
1) Which jobs in this field appeal to me the most?<br />
2) How much do they pay?<br />
3) How much education is required?<br />
4) What are their projections for the future?<br />
5) What kinds of working conditions are required?<br />
6) What kinds of skills are necessary?<br />
7) Do I stand a good chance of finding a job?<br />
<br />
Obviously, those seven questions aren't easily answered in a black-and-white, series-of-bullet-points, just-look-it-up-in-the-index manner. &nbsp;Thus, my "plan of attack" is simply to immerse myself in the jobs (in a timely manner, of course), getting as much information as I can from as many sources as I can, so that I can get the clearest possible picture of what to expect.<br />
<br />
I will begin with my next entry on jobs in the "Computer and Information Technology" career field. &nbsp;Some jobs in this field are:<br />
<br />
*Computer and information research scientists<br />
*Computer programmers<br />
*Computer systems analysts<br />
*Database administrators<br />
*Information security analysts<br />
*Web developers<br />
*Network and computer systems administrators<br />
*Software developers<br />
<br />
I've already given myself a tiny head-start with learning computer programming, from reading the first few chapters of "Beginning Computer Programming for Dummies" and from downloading Real Studio 2012 and using its tutorials. &nbsp;With "WCIYP" out of the way, I can now focus my energy entirely on learning more about computers and if they have a place in my future.<br />

<br />
That's all for today. &nbsp;As you know, today marks the beginning of some changes in my life, so I'm not entirely sure when I'll get to blog again. &nbsp;However, rest assured that, once I settle into my new job, the first "crash course" will be at the top of my to-do list.<br />
<br />
Here goes nothing!<br />
