<div style="text-align: left;">
Hello, and welcome to my blog!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
The purpose of this blog is to chronicle my journey as a young professional trying to find his place in the world. &nbsp;Before I get started, allow me to tell you about how I got to where I am and where I want to go from here...</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
In 2004, when I graduated high school, I enrolled in a university, majoring in Instrumental Music Education. &nbsp;I made good grades, I did good work, and I never had reason to doubt that what I was doing was right for me.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Then, in 2009, I was fortunate enough to be offered a teaching assistantship at a graduate school with one of the top Music Theory programs in the country. &nbsp;I felt like I was seeing the benefits of doing well up to that point, and I tackled the challenge of graduate school head-on.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Unfortunately, after a semester and a half of hard work, I began to realize that music was not the career for me. &nbsp;The love I originally had for it was disappearing; I felt like the more I learned about it, the less I cared. &nbsp;So, I dropped out. &nbsp;It wasn't an easy decision, but it was the right decision.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Since then, I've been on what some might call a "journey of self-discovery". &nbsp;I've moved several times, held several different jobs, and even tried my hand at a few other large-scale creative projects to fill the void that music used to.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
However, none of the places I've lived, none of the jobs I've held, and none of the creative projects I've completed have gotten me any closer to the lifestyle that I wanted for myself at this age (26). &nbsp;I can no longer hide from the fact that my "journey of self-discovery" must end, and a new journey must begin - a journey that I hope will lead me toward a new career, a new set of interests, and a new life. &nbsp;It is my hope that this blog will chronicle that journey in a way that may be fun, interesting, or helpful for others to read.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
So, what am I, now, then? &nbsp;Am I a musician? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Am I a success? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Am I what I wanted to be? No. &nbsp;I am but a man. &nbsp;A man with nothing more than a computer, a desk, and a dream...</div>
